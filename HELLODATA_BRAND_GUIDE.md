## Tone of Voice

### Writing Principles

#### 1. **Confident, Not Arrogant**
We know our stuff and we're not afraid to show it—but we're here to help, not to show off.

✅ "Get accurate rent comps in 60 seconds."  
❌ "Our revolutionary AI is the most advanced in the industry."

#### 2. **Clear, Not Dumbed Down**
Real estate pros are smart. Speak directly and skip the jargon, but don't oversimplify.

✅ "NOI projections based on real-time market data."  
❌ "We use fancy math to guess how much money you'll make."

#### 3. **Urgent, Not Pushy**
The market moves fast. Create energy without being salesy.

✅ "Three groups already toured. They had better data."  
❌ "BUY NOW before it's too late!!!"

#### 4. **Specific, Not Vague**
Numbers and specifics build trust. Abstract claims don't.

✅ "97% accuracy. 60 seconds. No manual work."  
❌ "Very accurate and really fast."

### Voice Examples

**Problem/Pain:**
> "By 2pm, you're still pulling comps manually. Spreadsheets. Browser tabs. Guesswork."

**Solution/Benefit:**
> "What if you had comps, expenses, and NOI in 60 seconds? Rent comps. Expense benchmarks. Similarity scores. Instantly."

**Call to Action:**
> "Screen faster. Bid smarter. Win more."

---

## Messaging Framework

### Taglines & Headlines

**Primary Tagline:**
> "Move faster. Know more. Win deals."

**Alternative Headlines:**
- "The fastest teams win the best deals."
- "Stop guessing. Start knowing."
- "Data that moves at market speed."
- "Your unfair advantage in multifamily."

### Value Propositions

| Audience | Key Message |
|----------|-------------|
| **Investors** | "Screen deals in seconds, not hours. Underwrite with confidence." |
| **Property Managers** | "Automate rent surveys. Get 5 hours back every week." |
| **Brokers** | "Comp faster. Price smarter. Close more." |
| **Developers** | "Market intelligence for every submarket, updated daily." |

### Pain Points to Address
1. Manual data collection is slow and error-prone
2. Competitors move faster because they have better data
3. Market data is stale by the time you get it
4. Spreadsheet chaos wastes hours every week
5. Pricing decisions are based on gut feel, not data

### Iconography

### UI Patterns
- **Cards:** Subtle shadows, rounded corners (8-12px), clean white or dark backgrounds

## Brand Don'ts

❌ Don't use gradients that feel "tech startup generic" (teal-to-pink, etc.)  
❌ Don't use casual or overly friendly language ("Hey there!")  
❌ Don't make vague claims without specifics  
❌ Don't use stock photos of people pointing at screens  
❌ Don't use more than 2-3 colors in a single composition  
❌ Don't sacrifice clarity for cleverness
